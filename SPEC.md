# PICKLEICIOUS - System Specification

## Overview

Pickleicious is a multi-tenant SaaS platform for pickleball facility management. It enables indoor pickleball venues to manage court reservations, member profiles, staff operations, and facility scheduling through a modern web interface optimized for front-desk operations.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Language | Go 1.22+ |
| HTTP Server | Standard library `net/http` |
| Templating | Templ (type-safe HTML) |
| Database | SQLite (mattn/go-sqlite3) |
| Query Generation | SQLC |
| Migrations | golang-migrate |
| Logging | Zerolog |
| Auth | AWS Cognito SDK v2, bcrypt (local) |
| Scheduler | gocron v2 |
| Interactivity | HTMX 1.9.10 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 3.4 |
| Build System | Taskfile (go-task) |
| Hot Reload | Air |

## Build System

The project uses Taskfile for build orchestration.

### Development Tasks

| Task | Description | Dependencies |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `dev` | Run development server without file watching | generate, css, db:migrate |
| `dev:watch` | Run development server with Air hot reload | generate, css, db:migrate |
| `generate` | Compile templ templates and sqlc queries | - |
| `generate-sqlc` | Generate sqlc queries only | - |
| `css` | Build Tailwind CSS | - |
| `db:migrate` | Run database migrations (creates db dir if needed) | - |
| `db:reset` | Delete database and re-run migrations | - |

### Test Tasks

| Task | Description | Dependencies |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `test` | Run all Go tests (unit, smoke, integration) | - |
| `test:unit` | Run unit tests (exclude smoke/integration tags) | generate-sqlc |
| `test:smoke` | Run smoke tests | generate-sqlc |
| `test:integration` | Run integration tests | generate-sqlc |

### Build Tasks

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `build` | Build server binary with generate and static_assets |
| `build:prod` | Build server binary for production (stripped symbols) |
| `static_assets` | Copy static assets to build output |
| `clean` | Remove build artifacts |

### One-Command Development Startup

Running `task dev` or `task dev:watch` automatically:
1. Generates templ templates and sqlc queries
2. Builds Tailwind CSS
3. Runs database migrations (idempotent - succeeds if already applied)
4. Starts the development server

No manual pre-steps are required to start development.

## Multi-Tenancy Model

```
Organization (corporate entity)
    └── Facility (physical location)
            ├── Courts
            ├── Members
            ├── Staff
            └── Operating Hours
```

- Organizations have custom Cognito configuration and domain
- Facilities have their own theme, timezone, and operating hours
- Members and staff are scoped to facilities

## Database Schema

### Core Entities

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|

| cognito_config | Per-org auth settings |

### Reservation System

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| reservation_types | Booking type lookup (GAME, PRO_SESSION, EVENT, MAINTENANCE, LEAGUE, TOURNAMENT) |
| recurrence_rules | Recurring patterns (WEEKLY, BIWEEKLY, MONTHLY) |
| reservations | Booking records |
| reservation_courts | Multi-court junction |
| reservation_participants | Multi-member junction |

### Key Constraints

- `organizations.slug` - UNIQUE
- `facilities.slug` - UNIQUE
- `users.email` - UNIQUE

| email | Unique email address |
| phone | 10-20 characters |
| date_of_birth | YYYY-MM-DD format |

| status | active, suspended, archived, deleted |
| home_facility_id | Primary location |
| membership_level | 0=Unverified Guest, 1=Verified Guest, 2=Member, 3+=Member+ |

### Member Photos

Photos are stored as BLOBs in the database with content_type and size metadata. The photo capture workflow uses browser MediaDevices API, captures to canvas, converts to Base64, and stores server-side.

### Soft Delete and Restoration

- Deleting a member sets status to 'deleted' (not physical delete)
- Deleted members are excluded from normal queries
- Creating a member with a deleted account's email offers restoration or new account creation

## Authentication

### Session Management

Two cookie-based session mechanisms operate in parallel:

| Cookie | Purpose | Used By |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `pickleicious_session` | In-memory token-based session | Staff local login |
| `pickleicious_auth` | HMAC-signed JSON payload | Dev mode bypass, future Cognito |

Session characteristics:
- 8-hour TTL for both session types
- HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookies
- Secure flag enabled in non-development environments
- In-memory session store with 15-minute cleanup interval
- Single active session per user (previous sessions cleared on new login)

### Staff Local Password Auth

Staff members with `local_auth_enabled=true` and a valid `password_hash` can authenticate via `/api/v1/auth/staff-login`:

1. Rate limiting applied (100/sec burst 10)
2. Lookup user by email or phone
3. Verify `is_staff=true` and `local_auth_enabled=true`
4. Verify bcrypt password hash
5. Create session token, set `pickleicious_session` cookie
6. Return `HX-Redirect: /` on success

Security measures:
- Generic "Invalid credentials" error regardless of failure reason
- Constant-time comparison via bcrypt
- Dummy hash verification when user not found (timing attack mitigation)

### Dev Mode Bypass

When `config.App.Environment == "development"`:
- Credentials `dev@test.local` / `devpass` bypass database lookup
- Creates authenticated session with `IsStaff=true`
- Optional `facility_id` parameter sets `HomeFacilityID`
- Warning logged: "Dev mode staff login bypass used"
- Completely disabled in non-development environments

### Passwordless Member Auth (Cognito)

1. Enter email/phone
2. Cognito sends OTP
3. Verify code
4. Create session

Note: Cognito integration handlers exist but are not yet fully implemented (marked TODO).

### Auth Middleware

The `WithAuth` middleware:
1. Attempts to load user from session token or auth cookie
2. If valid, attaches `AuthUser` to request context via `authz.ContextWithUser`
3. Proceeds to next handler regardless of auth status (endpoints enforce their own requirements)

## Authorization

### AuthUser Model

```go
type AuthUser struct {
    ID             int64
    IsStaff        bool
    HomeFacilityID *int64
}
```

### Facility Access Rules

| User Type | Access |
|-----------|--------|
| Staff with matching HomeFacilityID | Allowed |
| Staff with nil HomeFacilityID (admin) | Allowed to all facilities |
| Non-staff | Denied |
| Unauthenticated | Denied |

### Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 401 | Unauthenticated - no valid session |
| 403 | Forbidden - authenticated but lacks permission |

## UI Framework

### Layout

- Fixed top navigation with menu toggle, search, theme toggle, notifications
- Slide-out menu with Dashboard, Courts, Members, Settings
- User section with avatar, name, email

### HTMX Patterns

| Pattern | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| hx-get | Load content fragments |
| hx-post | Form submissions |
| hx-put | Update operations |
| hx-delete | Delete operations |
| hx-trigger | Custom events, delays |
| hx-target | Where to swap content |
| hx-swap | How to swap (innerHTML, outerHTML) |
| HX-Trigger | Server-sent events |
| HX-Redirect | Server-initiated redirects (used after login) |

## Configuration

### config.yaml

```yaml
app:
  name: "Pickleicious"
  environment: "development"
  port: 8080
  base_url: "http://localhost:8080"
  secret_key: "your-secret-key-here"  # Required

database:
  driver: "sqlite"
  filename: "build/db/pickleicious.db"

features:
  enable_metrics: false
  enable_tracing: false
  enable_debug: true
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| APP_SECRET_KEY | Application secret (required for auth cookie signing) |
| DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN | Turso auth token |
| STATIC_DIR | Override static file path |

### Validation

Config validation enforces:
- `app.port` required
- `app.secret_key` required
- `database.driver` required

## Middleware Stack

1. WithLogging - Request/response logging
2. WithRecovery - Panic recovery
3. WithRequestID - UUID per request
4. WithAuth - Load auth session into context
5. WithContentType - Default Accept header

## Testing Infrastructure

### Test Database Helper

`internal/testutil.NewTestDB(t)` creates temporary SQLite databases with migrations applied for testing.

### Test Categories

| Category | Build Tag | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Unit | (none) | Fast isolated tests |
| Smoke | `smoke` | Server startup and basic endpoint tests |
| Integration | `integration` | Full database and handler tests |

### GitHub Actions

PR checks workflow (`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`):
1. Checkout code
2. Setup Go from `go.mod`
3. Install task, templ, sqlc
4. Run `task generate`
5. Run `task test:smoke`
